Synesthesia Network claims to be different than other blockchains. The vision documents you can find in this section should help explain why.

At a high level, Synesthesia will focus on user experience over pure efficiency.

Synesthesia will not be the blockchain that is fastest, cheapest, or has the highest throughput...
but it may very well be the blockchain with the best end to end user experience for doing things on
the network.

This is not to say that poor design or bad practices will be used to build the network. Simply that
approaching problems or choosing between close decisions in implementation details will favor the
end users.

By starting at the blockchain system with a user first mentality and keeping in mind the user
interfaces that will be created for those systems, we can strive to change the way people think
about and interact with the decentralized web.
